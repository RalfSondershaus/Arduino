   3.9.1 Fundamental types [basic.fundamental]

   Objects declared as characters (char) shall be large enough to store any member of the 
   implementation's basic character set. If a character from this set is stored in a character 
   object, the integral value of that character object is equal to the value of the single 
   character literal form of that character. It is implementation-defined whether a char 
   object can hold negative values. Characters can be explicitly declared unsigned or signed. 
   Plain char, signed char, and unsigned char are three distinct types. A char, a signed char,
   and an unsigned char occupy the same amount of storage and have the same alignment 
   requirements (basic.types); that is, they have the same object representation. 
   For character types, all bits of the object representation participate in the value 
   representation. For unsigned character types, all possible bit patterns of the value 
   representation represent numbers. These requirements do not hold for other types. In any 
   particular implementation, a plain char object can take on either the same values as a 
   signed char or an unsigned char; which one is implementation-defined.

/* 
  integer types.

  For AVR - GCC compiler, we derive below types from stdint.h.

  Remark: AVR GCC stdint.h uses __attribute__ definitions:
  QI: An integer that is as wide as the smallest addressable unit, usually 8 bits.
  HI: An integer, twice as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 16 bits.
  SI: An integer, four times as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 32 bits.
  DI: An integer, eight times as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 64 bits.
  SF: A floating point value, as wide as a SI mode integer, usually 32 bits.
  DF: A floating point value, as wide as a DI mode integer, usually 64 bits.
  From a 32-bit perspective:
  QI - Quarter Int
  HI - Half Int
  SI - Single Int
  DI - Double Int
  SF - Single Float
  DF - Double Float
